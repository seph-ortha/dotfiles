## ---------• Options
### • AUTO_CD (-J)
## Automatically cd into typed directory.
### • INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS (-k)
## Allow comments even in interactive shells.
### • PROMPT_SUBST
## Parameter & Arithmetic Expansion & Command Substitution.
### • PROMPT_PERCENT
## Certain escape sequences that start with % are expanded.
### • EXTENDED GLOB
## Treat the '#' '~' and '^' as part of patterns for filename generation, etc.
### • NOMATCH (+3)
## If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, print an error, instead
## of leaving it unchanged in the argument list. This also applies to file
## expansion of an initial '~' or '='
### • MENU_COMPLETE (-Y)
## On ambibuous completion, instead of listing possibilities or beeping, insert
## the first match immediately. Then when completion is requested again, remove
## the first match and insert the second match, etc. When there are no more matches
## go back to the first one again. reverse-menu-complete may be used to loop through
## the list in the other direction. This option overrides AUTO_MENU.
